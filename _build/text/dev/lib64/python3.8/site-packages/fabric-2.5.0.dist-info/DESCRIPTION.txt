To find out whatâ€™s new in this version of Fabric, please see the
changelog.


Welcome to Fabric!
******************

Fabric is a high level Python (2.7, 3.4+) library designed to execute
shell commands remotely over SSH, yielding useful Python objects in
return. It builds on top of Invoke (subprocess command execution and
command-line features) and Paramiko (SSH protocol implementation),
extending their APIs to complement one another and provide additional
functionality.

For a high level introduction, including example code, please see our
main project website; or for detailed API docs, see the versioned API
website.
