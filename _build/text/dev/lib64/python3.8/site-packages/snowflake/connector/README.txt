******************************

[image][image][image][image][image]

This package includes the Snowflake Connector for Python, which
conforms to the Python DB API 2.0 specification:
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/

The Snowflake Connector for Python provides an interface for
developing Python applications that can connect to Snowflake and
perform all standard operations. It provides a programming alternative
to developing applications in Java or C/C++ using the Snowflake JDBC
or ODBC drivers.

The connector is a native, pure Python package that has no
dependencies on JDBC or ODBC. It can be installed using "pip" on
Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows platforms where Python 3.5.0 (or higher)
is installed.
