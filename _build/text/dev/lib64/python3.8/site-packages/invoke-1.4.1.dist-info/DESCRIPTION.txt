To find out what’s new in this version of Invoke, please see the
changelog.


Welcome to Invoke!
******************

Invoke is a Python (2.7 and 3.4+) library for managing shell-oriented
subprocesses and organizing executable Python code into CLI-invokable
tasks. It draws inspiration from various sources ("make"/"rake",
Fabric 1.x, etc) to arrive at a powerful & clean feature set.

For a high level introduction, including example code, please see our
main project website; or for detailed API docs, see the versioned API
website.
