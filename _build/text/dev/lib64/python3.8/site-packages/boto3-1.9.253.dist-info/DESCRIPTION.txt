Boto 3 - The AWS SDK for Python
*******************************

[image: Build Status][image] [image: Version][image] [image:
Gitter][image]

Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK)
for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that
makes use of services like Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2. You can find the
latest, most up to date, documentation at our doc site, including a
list of services that are supported.


Quick Start
===========

First, install the library and set a default region:

   $ pip install boto3

Next, set up credentials (in e.g. "~/.aws/credentials"):

   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET

Then, set up a default region (in e.g. "~/.aws/config"):

   [default]
   region=us-east-1

Then, from a Python interpreter:

   >>> import boto3
   >>> s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
   >>> for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
           print(bucket.name)


Development
===========


Getting Started
---------------

Assuming that you have Python and "virtualenv" installed, set up your
environment and install the required dependencies like this instead of
the "pip install boto3" defined above:

   $ git clone https://github.com/boto/boto3.git
   $ cd boto3
   $ virtualenv venv
   ...
   $ . venv/bin/activate
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ pip install -e .


Running Tests
-------------

You can run tests in all supported Python versions using "tox". By
default, it will run all of the unit and functional tests, but you can
also specify your own "nosetests" options. Note that this requires
that you have all supported versions of Python installed, otherwise
you must pass "-e" or run the "nosetests" command directly:

   $ tox
   $ tox -- unit/test_session.py
   $ tox -e py26,py33 -- integration/

You can also run individual tests with your default Python version:

   $ nosetests tests/unit


Generating Documentation
------------------------

Sphinx is used for documentation. You can generate HTML locally with
the following:

   $ pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
   $ cd docs
   $ make html


Getting Help
============

We use GitHub issues for tracking bugs and feature requests and have
limited bandwidth to address them. Please use these community
resources for getting help:

* Ask a question on Stack Overflow and tag it with boto3

* Come join the AWS Python community chat on gitter

* Open a support ticket with AWS Support
