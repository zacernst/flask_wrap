What is Alabaster?
******************

Alabaster is a visually (c)lean, responsive, configurable theme for
the Sphinx documentation system. It is Python 2+3 compatible.

It began as a third-party theme, and is still maintained separately,
but as of Sphinx 1.3, Alabaster is an install-time dependency of
Sphinx and is selected as the default theme.

Live examples of this theme can be seen on this projectâ€™s own website,
paramiko.org, fabfile.org and pyinvoke.org.

For more documentation, please see http://alabaster.readthedocs.io.

Note:

  You can install the development version via "pip install -e
  git+https://github.com/bitprophet/alabaster/#egg=alabaster".
